and the number of bound signs determines what heading this is

# GitHub.com uses its own version of the Markdown syntax that provides an additional set of useful features,
# many of which make it easier to work with content on GitHub.com.


# tables
you can assemble tables by sepparating them with - for the first row and a | for each column
First Header | Second Header
------------ | -------------
Content from cell 1 | Content from cell 2
Content in the first column | Content in the second column


you can also strike a line through words simply use this ~~this text is striked~~ use ~~  ~~ just do not leave a space between the sign and the text


### any url will be converted to a clickable one

#### mentions are easy use @ before the user name and they will be notified, just like facebook


# Any number that refers to an Issue or Pull Request will be automatically converted into a link.

# git hub pages allows you to turn github repositories into elegant websites


### to show off anything you want


advantages:
1 no data bases to set up
2 no servers to configure 
3 sometimes you dont even have to know HTML



*you can use syntax highlighting in markdown*
the following syntax was taken as is
```
javascript
function fancyAlert(arg) {
  if(arg) {
    $.facebox({div:'#foo'})
  }
}
```


# if ypu want to build awseome websites do it with jakyl
## jakyl is an open source tool that transforms plain text files into websites


since your git hub file are a part of github repository you can maintain them using the same tools you use on github and when you are ready to publish cahnges just merge them
 
 
 
 #### the beauty of it is that you dont have to memorize the markdown, simply go to [Basic writing and formatting syntax](https://docs.github.com/en/github/writing-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax) to see all of them
 
 
 you can see how to control headings, text type, styling options and much more 
 
 
 you can even see how to call out codes I will give an example
 
 
 ##### search for the quoting code


You can call out code or a command within a sentence with single backticks. The text within the backticks will not be formatted. 


any thing between `whatever text is here` 

### To format code or text into its own distinct block, use triple backticks.

Some basic Git commands are:
```
git status
git add
git commit
```

what about tasks list.
To create a task list, preface list items with a regular space character followed by [ ]. To mark a task as complete, use [x]. also retrived from the githib bookmarks


- [x] Finish my changes
- [x] Push my commits to GitHub
- [ ] Open a pull request
